def training(H, loss, global_step):
  """
  Set up the training Ops.

  Creates a summarizer to track the loss over time in TensorBoard.

  Creates an optimizer and applies the gradients to all trainable variables.

  The Op returned by this function is what must be passed to the
  `sess.run()` call to cause the model to train.

  Parameters
  ----------
  loss : Loss tensor, from loss().
  global_step : Integer Variable counting the number of training steps
      processed.
  learning_rate : The learning rate to use for gradient descent.

  Returns
  -------
  train_op: The Op for training.
